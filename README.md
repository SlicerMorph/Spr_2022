## Computer and software instructions 
For this course, we will be using SlicerMorphCloud. [Please follow these instructions to access it.](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Spr_2022/blob/main/Cloud/README.md) As a backup, we advise installing 3D Slicer and SlicerMorph extension to your laptop. You can download 3D Slicer from https://download.slicer.org (use the latest preview) and [instructions for installing SlicerMorph can be found here](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph#installation). We also suggest installing R and Rstudio locally on your computer. Both are available on the SlicerMorphCloud. 

**Good to haves:**	
*	A large external monitor (dual screen is preferred) 
*	A three-buttoned mouse. 

**Accounts:** Please obtain an account on these websites prior to workshop
*	MorphoSource: https://morphosource.org (so that you can download datasets directly from MorphoSource to the SlicerMorphCloud)
*	Slicer Forum, https://discourse.slicer.org (alternatively you can use your github or google accounts to signup)
